## What is this?

This is a sample project when I am learning Pytorch. 

The goal of the project is able to classify images of three different food: sushi, steak, pizza.

This is a classic CNN deep learning model. 

To achieve higher model accuracy, I implemented transferred learning using EfficientNet_B0 network, and re-configured the fully connected layer.

## To start

##### Clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/zhuolisam/pytorch-learning
    cd transfer_learning

##### Install packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt

##### Run model_training.ipynb
